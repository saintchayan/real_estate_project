    {% translate 'The Healthcare System In Turkey' %}
</h3>
<p>
    {% translate 'Healthcare in Turkey consists of both public and private health services. The Ministry of Health (MOH), universities, and the private sector provide healthcare services. Foreigners and expats living in Turkey can apply for health benefits in two ways;  Universal Health Insurance and private health insurance. The European Health Insurance Card is not efficient in Turkey. Also, health insurance is compulsory in Turkey. Thus, you’ll need health insurance to get residency or work permits.' %}

<h3>
    {% translate 'Universal Health Insurance in Turkey' %}
</h3>
<p>
    {% translate 'Universal Health Insurance covers most health issues such as emergencies, pregnancy, and illnesses. Social Security Institution (SGK) administers general healthcare in Turkey.  To do so, you need to contact the nearest social security center. If you enroll in this scheme, you can also enjoy discounts in private hospitals. But, note that state hospitals are sometimes very crowded.' %}

<p>
    {% translate 'If you’ve lived in Turkey for one year, you’re eligible to apply. You can access all the medical care with a monthly fee. The monthly premium for 2021 is about ₺850, and it changes every year. You can get updated information from the application centers for healthcare in Turkey for foreigners. There are approximately 600 social security centers in the country.  When you apply for SGK, your spouse and children under 18 can benefit from healthcare for foreigners.' %}

These are shorter waiting times, the highest quality of care, and fewer unexpected expenses. Also, it’s easy to find more English-speaking doctors in private hospitals. So, you may prefer a private healthcare option rather than SGK.' %}
